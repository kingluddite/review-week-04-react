# Spread syntax
* Introduced in ES6 to help make our code cleaner and easier to understand

## What is the spread operator?
* Just three dots `...`

## What can the spread operator be used on?
* iterables like an array or a string

## What does it do?
* It expands an iterable to it's individual elements
* It can provide a function call with an array (or any other iterable) where 0 or more arguments were expected

### Example
* See EXAMPLE1 in index.js

## Where can we use the Spread Operator?
* Inside function calls (when using this we call it the "rest parameter")
* Creating/extending an array/iterables
* Used as an argument for a "variadic function" (a function which can have a variable number of parameters)
